Upper bounds. T(n) is O(f(n)) if there exist constants c>0 and n0>=0 
such that for all n>=n0 we have T(n)<=c*f(n).

Lower bounds. T(n) is Ω(f(n)) if there exist constants c>0 and n0>=0 
such that for all n>=n0 we have T(n)》=c*f(n).

Tight bounds. T(n) is Θ(f(n)) if T(n) is both O(f(n)) and  Ω(f(n)).
